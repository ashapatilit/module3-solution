          <h3 class="text-center">Chicken</h3>
          <div class="menu-content">
            <p>Our restaurant takes pride in offering the finest chicken dishes from around the world. We source our chicken from local farms that practice humane and sustainable farming methods. Each bird is raised without antibiotics and fed a natural diet, resulting in tender, flavorful meat that serves as the perfect foundation for our diverse menu offerings.</p>
            
            <p>Our signature dish, the Herb-Roasted Chicken, features a whole chicken marinated overnight in a blend of fresh herbs, garlic, and citrus. Slow-roasted to perfection, the skin develops a golden, crispy exterior while the meat remains juicy and tender. Served with roasted seasonal vegetables and our house-made gravy, this dish exemplifies comfort food at its finest.</p>
            
            <p>For those seeking something with a bit more heat, our Nashville Hot Chicken has become a customer favorite. We start with premium chicken pieces that are brined for 24 hours before being dredged in our secret flour mixture. After frying to golden perfection, each piece is brushed with our signature spice oil, creating layers of flavor that range from mild to "call the fire department" hot. Served with cooling pickles and creamy coleslaw, this dish offers a perfect balance of flavors and textures.</p>
            
            <p>Our Chicken Tikka Masala pays homage to one of the world's most beloved chicken preparations. Chunks of chicken breast are marinated in yogurt and authentic Indian spices before being chargrilled in our tandoor oven. The partially cooked chicken is then simmered in a rich, aromatic tomato-based sauce enriched with cream, creating a dish that's both comforting and exotic. Served with basmati rice and warm naan bread, it's a complete meal that transports your taste buds to the streets of Delhi.</p>
            
            <p>Health-conscious diners will appreciate our Mediterranean Grilled Chicken Salad. Marinated in olive oil, lemon, and Mediterranean herbs, the chicken is grilled to perfection and served atop a bed of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, kalamata olives, and feta cheese. Dressed with our house-made lemon-herb vinaigrette, this salad is both satisfying and nutritious.</p>
            
            <p>For a taste of the Far East, our General Tso's Chicken combines crispy fried chicken pieces with a sauce that perfectly balances sweet, tangy, and spicy notes. Garnished with sesame seeds and scallions and served with steamed rice, this dish pays tribute to American-Chinese cuisine while elevating it with quality ingredients and thoughtful preparation.</p>
            
            <p>Our Coq au Vin is a testament to the timeless appeal of classic French cuisine. Chicken pieces are slowly braised in red wine with bacon, mushrooms, and pearl onions until the meat is fall-off-the-bone tender. The rich sauce, reduced to velvety perfection, is finished with a touch of butter for unparalleled richness. Served with crusty bread for sopping up every last drop of sauce, this dish exemplifies rustic elegance.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Beef</h3>
          <div class="menu-content">
            <p>At Food, LLC, our beef selection represents the pinnacle of quality and taste. We exclusively source our beef from farms that practice sustainable, ethical raising methods. Our partnerships with local ranchers ensure that all our beef comes from cattle that have been grass-fed and finished, resulting in meat that's not only better for you but also boasts superior flavor and texture.</p>
            
            <p>The crown jewel of our beef offerings is undoubtedly our Dry-Aged Prime Ribeye. Each steak is aged in-house for a minimum of 28 days in our custom aging room. This patient process allows natural enzymes to break down the muscle fibers, concentrating the flavor and creating the buttery tenderness that steak enthusiasts crave. Seasoned simply with sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper, then grilled over hardwood to your preferred temperature, this steak needs no embellishment to shine.</p>
            
            <p>Our Classic Beef Wellington represents the height of culinary craftsmanship. We start with center-cut beef tenderloin, seared to develop a flavorful crust while maintaining a rare interior. The meat is then coated with a mushroom duxelles, wrapped in prosciutto, and encased in delicate puff pastry before being baked to golden perfection. Sliced tableside and served with a red wine reduction, this dish transforms any meal into a special occasion.</p>
            
            <p>For those who appreciate the art of slow cooking, our Braised Beef Short Ribs offer unparalleled richness and depth of flavor. We begin by searing the meat to develop a caramelized exterior, then braise it for hours in a mixture of red wine, aromatic vegetables, and herbs. The result is beef so tender it can be cut with a fork, served in its reduced cooking liquid atop creamy polenta with roasted root vegetables.</p>
            
            <p>Our house-ground burger has developed a cult following among locals. We blend three cuts of beef—chuck, short rib, and brisket—to create a patty with the perfect fat-to-lean ratio. Grilled over an open flame and served on a toasted brioche bun with house-made pickles, aged cheddar, caramelized onions, and our signature sauce, this burger elevates a classic American favorite to gourmet status.</p>
            
            <p>Drawing inspiration from Asian cuisine, our Korean-Style Beef Bulgogi features thinly sliced ribeye marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, Asian pear, garlic, and ginger. Flash-grilled to maintain tenderness, the beef develops delicious caramelized edges while remaining juicy. Served with steamed rice, kimchi, and an array of banchan (small side dishes), this dish offers a symphony of flavors and textures.</p>
            
            <p>Our Beef Bourguignon pays homage to the French countryside. Chunks of beef shoulder are slowly simmered in Burgundy wine with bacon lardons, pearl onions, and mushrooms until the meat becomes fork-tender and the sauce reduces to a silky consistency. Garnished with fresh parsley and served with buttered noodles, this dish exemplifies comfort food elevated to fine dining status.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
          <div class="menu-content">
            <p>Our sushi program at Food, LLC represents our commitment to honoring Japanese culinary traditions while incorporating creative, contemporary elements. We source our seafood from sustainable fisheries, with fresh deliveries arriving daily to ensure peak quality and flavor. Our rice—the foundation of great sushi—is prepared according to time-honored methods, seasoned with a house-made blend of vinegars for the perfect balance of flavor and texture.</p>
            
            <p>Leading our sushi kitchen is Master Chef Hiroshi Tanaka, who trained for over a decade in Tokyo before bringing his expertise to our restaurant. Chef Tanaka's meticulous attention to detail is evident in every piece of nigiri and roll that leaves our kitchen. From the precise knife cuts to the artful presentation, each plate reflects both technical mastery and artistic vision.</p>
            
            <p>Our Omakase experience allows Chef Tanaka to showcase the finest seasonal ingredients through a progression of sushi and sashimi. This "chef's choice" dining experience begins with lighter fare and progresses through increasingly rich flavors, creating a journey that highlights both the quality of our ingredients and the skill of our chefs. Limited to eight diners per evening, this intimate experience includes interaction with Chef Tanaka, who explains each course and its preparation.</p>
            
            <p>For those new to sushi or seeking familiar favorites, our Classic Roll Selection offers perfected versions of beloved standards. Our California Roll features real snow crab (never imitation), ripe avocado, and cucumber, while our Spicy Tuna Roll combines fresh bluefin tuna with a house-made spicy sauce that complements rather than overwhelms the fish's natural flavor. Each roll is crafted with precision, ensuring perfect balance in every bite.</p>
            
            <p>Our Signature Rolls showcase Chef Tanaka's creative approach to sushi. The Truffle Rainbow Roll wraps Alaskan king crab and avocado inside, crowned with layers of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and avocado, then finished with black truffle shavings and truffle oil. The Fire and Ice Roll contrasts torched salmon with cool cucumber and mint, creating an interplay of temperatures and flavors that delights the palate.</p>
            
            <p>Sashimi enthusiasts will appreciate our daily selection of pristine fish, sliced to highlight each variety's unique texture and flavor. From buttery hamachi (yellowtail) to rich, marbled o-toro (fatty tuna belly), each selection is presented with artistic flair and accompanied by freshly grated wasabi—never the powdered variety found at lesser establishments.</p>
            
            <p>Our vegetarian sushi offerings are crafted with the same care as our seafood options. The Gardener's Roll combines pickled daikon, cucumber, avocado, and micro greens, while our Mushroom Nigiri features various mushrooms seasoned and prepared to mimic the texture and umami flavor of traditional fish-based nigiri.</p>
